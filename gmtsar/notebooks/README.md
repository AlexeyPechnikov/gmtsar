## PyGMTSAR (Python GMTSAR)

I'm a freelancer and that's my free time Open Source project. In 2005 my master's thesis was awarded first prize of the
All-Russian Physics competition for significant results in Inverse modeling for non-linear optics and holography and so
I know a lot about interferometry modeling. Sure, I have lots of ideas about new features but my free time is very limited
and I can't promise anything. You are able to sponsor my projects on [Patreon: Become a Patron!](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=54500608) and order research, development and support on [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01e65e8e7221758623)

The goal of the project is easy and fast satellite interferometry (InSAR) processing everywhere
from local host to cloud environments. Really, we are able to use even free of charge services like to Google Colab
which are powerful enough for processing about 10 interferograms in 30 minutes.
MacOS and Linux Debian are my prefered OSes and I support them both. By the way, please don't ask me about Windows support
while you don't ready to pay for it.
